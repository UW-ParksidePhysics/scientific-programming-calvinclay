# Does the code run without error? YES
# If any error occurs, can you suggest a potential fix? N/A
#
# How understandable is the output of the code?
# WITHOUT READING ALL THE CODE AND KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON, IT'S NOT EASY TO DETERMINE WHAT THESE OUTPUTS ARE/REPRESENT
#
# Point out any parts you do not understand.
# FROM HOW I INTERPRET THE CODE, EVERYTHING SEEMS RELATIVELY CLEAR, HOWEVER SOME TEXT INDICATING EXACTLY WHAT YOU AND \
#   EACH FUNCTION IS DOING WOULD BE HELPFUL, AS WELL AS ADDING UNITS TO YOUR VARIABLES
#
# How readable is the code itself?
# CLEAR, CLEAN, AND EASY TO READ
#
# Say where formatting or commenting would make the code more readable or where PEP-8 is violated.
# ALL SQUIGGLY LINES INDICATE WHERE PEP-8 IS VIOLATED, COMMENTING WOULD BE USEFUL ANYTIME A NEW FUNCTION IS USED\
#   AND HAVING THE VARIABLE NAMES BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE/CONCRETE WOULD HELP GIVE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS
#
# How clearly do the code comments describe the problem it is trying to solve?
# NOT AS CLEARLY AS I'D LIKE. SOME INFERRING/INTERPRETING HAS TO BE DONE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS BEING SOLVED
#
# Identify places that would benefit from a clearer comment.
# THE IF STATEMENT, AND FOR LOOP THAT ARE PULLING IN DATA, AS WELL AS THE DICTIONARY THAT'S BEING SET UP WITH THEM.
#   ALL SUBSEQUENT FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS WHAT YOU'RE PRINTING/PLOTTING IN THE PRINT AND PLOT STATEMENTS
#
# How clearly do the variable names relate to the concepts they concretize?
# CLEARLY ENOUGH TO DECIPHER, ALTHOUGH MORE DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES MIGHT BE NICER.
#
# Point out any variables you don't recognize, and/or suggest better names. Check for PEP-8 compliance.
# k, Y: IS THE Y ACTUALLY GAMMA? IS k A CONSTANT? INCLUDING UNITS/STATING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO DISTINGUISH AS WELL
#
# How well does the range of variables capture the problem described?
# AS OF RIGHT NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE ONLY ONE SET OF VARIABLES IS USED SO IT DOESN'T SHOW EXACTLY HOW THE OUTPUT WILL \
#   CHANGE AS THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLES CHANGE
#
# Identify extraneous regions that could be left out or important regions that should be included.
# I MIGHT INCLUDE A FEW MORE VALUES OF PRESSURE AND VOLUME TO INCLUDE IN YOUR PLOT
#
# To what degree does the script follow a functional programming paradigm, packaging all major components of the script
# into separately defined functions that pass information among them in a small number of lines? Identify ways in which
# the functionalization of the code could be improved.
# FROM WHAT I SEE, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WELL ORGANIZED\
#   I DON'T KNOW THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY COULD BE IMPROVED ASIDE FROM RECOMMENDATIONS I MADE EARLIER.
#
# How clearly do the visualizations show the solutions to the problem?
# THIS IS MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THE CODE I SEE SO FAR.  IT COULD JUST BE HOW IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW, BUT I DO NOT SEE \
#   HOW THE GRAPH SHOWS THE PROBLEMS SOLUTION.
#
# Say if there is extraneous whitespace or the co-domain or domain of the data should be changed or any other ways the
# visualizations could be more effective
# THERE IS CERTAINLY EXTRANEOUS WHITESPACE THAT COULD BE FILLED WITH DIFFERENT VALUES OF PRESSURE, VOLUME, AND WHATEVER\
#   OTHER VARIABLES ARE INPUTTED.  THIS COULD HELP VISUALIZE THE CHANGE IN THE OUTPUT AS THE INPUTS CHANGE AND POSSIBLY\
#   MORE CLEARLY DISPLAY A SOLUTION.
